Text generator with dynamic output built for the web. Uses a combination of the work from the Tarako Gorge remix and Bluesky bots I made as well as the in-class demos 
for Creative Code & Generative AI. Extended using genAI coding methods, as modeled during the demos.

Books used:

1. Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley

2. Peter Pan [PETER AND WENDY] by J. M. Barrie [James Matthew Barrie]

3. DRACULA by Bram Stoker
